    <h1>Hola!</h1>
    <p>I'm Paulo! ðŸ‘‹</p>
    <p>
      I'm a frontend developer with a background in electronics and human
      centered design currently working at <a
        href="www.verndale.com"
        target="_blank">Verndale</a
      >. I'm passionate about problem-solving and connecting people through
      meaningful and innovative experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my career, I have been part of several projects that have
      allowed me to explore and build experiences around the boundaries of both
      physical and digital worlds. From websites to multimedia installations
      using AR, VR and experimental interfaces, I have had the opportunity to
      learn from many technologies and from amazing professionals using them
      around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity helps me keep up to date with new tools and I am always happy to
      keep learning in order to successfully deliver new projects.
    </p>
    <p>I love pizza, unique color palettes and mountaineering.</p>
