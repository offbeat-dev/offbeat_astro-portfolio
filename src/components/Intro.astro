    <h1>Hola!</h1>
    <p>I'm Paulo! üëã</p>
    <p>
      I'm a frontend developer with a background in electronics and human
      centered design currently working at <a
        href="www.verndale.com"
        target="_blank">Verndale</a
      >. I'm passionate about problem-solving and connecting people through
      meaningful and innovative experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my career, I have been part of several projects that have
      allowed me to explore and build experiences around the boundaries of both
      physical and digital worlds. From websites to multimedia installations
      using AR, VR and experimental interfaces, I've had the privilege of
      learning from a diverse range of cutting-edge technologies and outstanding
      professionals worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity drives me to stay current with the latest tools, and I'm eager
      to continuously expand my knowledge to ensure the successful execution of
      new projects.
    </p>
    <p>I love pizza üçï, unique color palettes üé® and mountaineering üèîÔ∏è.</p>
